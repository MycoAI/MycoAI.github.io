We come to the MycoAI lab's website. 

Our lab focusses on developing and applying computational techniques to gain insights into biological processes and patterns in fungal biodiversity.. These include Artificial Intelligence (AI), clustering, visualization, and analysis tools and pipelines for eDNA metabarcoding/metagenomics, genomics, and transcriptomics data generated from fungal strains preserved in the WI-CBS collection as well as data available from public repositories.
