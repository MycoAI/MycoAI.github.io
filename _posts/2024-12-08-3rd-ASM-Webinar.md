I will share my work on fungal identification from the environment and clinical samples next Saturday at 1:30 PM (VN time) during 
[the ASM-Vietnam Webinar Series: the 3rd Webinar - Infection Control and Medical Microbiology](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1A2PkGUdP3/). 
In this presentation, I will focus on the application of the Bioinformatics tools 
we have developed in recent years and the reference dataset we generated at the [Westerdijk Institute](https://wi.knaw.nl/) for fungal identification. 
With this dataset, we won the Dutch Data Prize in 2022!
