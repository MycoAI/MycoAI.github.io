I would like to share with you a great news: Together with Gerard Verkleij, we won the Dutch Data Prize 2022 in the Life Sciences category for the dataset released in the paper [Large-scale generation and analysis of filamentous fungal DNA barcodes boosts coverage for kingdom fungi and reveals thresholds for fungal species and higher taxon delimitation](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/wfbi/sim/2019/00000092/00000001/art00004). This dataset has been world-wide used. At the time, we were awarded, the dataset had more than 500 citations! Kudos to all the technicians and scientists involved in this project, from data generation and management to validation and release!
