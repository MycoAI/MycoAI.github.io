Today, I had a productive working day at the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/), engaging in a fruitful discussion with 
[Cunliang Geng](https://github.com/cunliangGeng) about our new tool [TaxoTagger](https://github.com/MycoAI/TaxoTagger) 
for efficient species identification using eDNA, coupled with AI and 
powered by semantic searching in the AID project. 
What a great place to work, full of enthusiastic and skilled software engineers tackling various challenges in science!
