I am thrilled to join the Utrecht Bioinformatics Center ([https://ubc.uu.nl/](https://ubc.uu.nl/)) as one of the PIs. 
This opportunity allows me to expand my knowledge, collaborate with fellow researchers who share similar interests, 
and hopefully attract more students with computational skills to tackle various big data challenges in fungal research! 
Check out the following interview ([https://ubc.uu.nl/meet-ubc-principal-investigator-duong-vu/](https://ubc.uu.nl/meet-ubc-principal-investigator-duong-vu/)) 
to learn more about my bioinformatics research at the [Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute](https://wi.knaw.nl/).
