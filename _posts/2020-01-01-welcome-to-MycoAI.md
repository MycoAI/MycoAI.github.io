Welcome to MycoAI's website. 
Our team focusses on developing and applying computational techniques to gain insights into biological processes and patterns in fungal biodiversity.
These include Artificial Intelligence (AI), clustering, visualization, and analysis tools and pipelines for eDNA metabarcoding/metagenomics, genomics, and 
transcriptomics data generated from fungal strains preserved in the [Westerdijk Institute](https://wi.knaw.nl/)'s CBS collection as well as data available from public repositories.
