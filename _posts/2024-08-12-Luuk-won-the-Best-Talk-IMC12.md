I am so proud to see my student, Luuk Romeijn from 
[LIACS]https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/, presented our work on [MycoAI](https://github.com/MycoAI/MycoAI) and won one of the three Best Talks at the Early Career Mycologists Symposium at the 12th International Mycological Congress ([IMC12](https://imc12.org/)). 
[Our paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1755-0998.14006) was also accepted this week! Looking forward to continuing our exciting journey in eDNA research!
