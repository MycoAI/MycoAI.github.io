I would like to share with you a great news: Together with Gerard Verkleij, we won the Dutch Data Prize 2022 in the Life Sciences category for the dataset released in the paper [Large-scale generation and analysis of filamentous fungal DNA barcodes boosts coverage for kingdom fungi and reveals thresholds for fungal species and higher taxon delimitation](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/wfbi/sim/2019/00000092/00000001/art00004). This dataset has been world-wide used. At the time, we were awarded, the dataset had more than 500 citations! Kudos to all the technicians and scientists of the [Westerdijk Institute]() involved in this project, from data generation and management to validation and release!
